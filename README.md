# ChatIE

**NOTE: It's a rebuilt version of [ChatIE](https://github.com/cocacola-lab/ChatIE) project from cocacola-lab BJTU**

> [GPT4IE](https://github.com/lavanceeee/GPT4IE) is a clean version of ChatIE, which integrats two data processing and uses only one set of prompt. The result are equally execellent!

## What I have done

- [x] double language Information Extraction

- [x] basic interface

- [ ] visualization and save function of IE result 

1. I rebuilt the entire project using JS making it more clean and pure: anandoned Flask and integrated them into fronted.

2. I restructured all processing logic in a more systematic and engineering-oriented way: I found numerous "unreasonable" varable and overly complex processing logic, which made the entire project "bloated"ðŸ¤”, I applied layered processing and logical decouping to reduce complexity and make the project easier to understand.

## What I learned ðŸ¤œ

Zero-shot Information Extraction attemtps to get structured information using LLMs also prompt-engineering. Using modern LLMs API, such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, structured information extraction has been achieved through prompt-driven, multi-turn conversations.
